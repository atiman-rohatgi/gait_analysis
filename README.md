# gait_analysis
(this is a sample level project for showace purposes, utilizing simmilar architecture and framworks)
- Worked on a research project that focused on detecting chronic diseases with the use of gait. Designed an end to end ML pipeline,
leveraging python libraries, signal preprocessing and feature engineering to automate diagnostics.
- Processed over 15000+ gait samples to extract features, used Logistic Regression to achieve 80% predictive accuracy.
